# Menstrual Health Risk Prediction System

A machine learning–based web application that predicts menstrual health risks such as **Normal**, **PCOS**, **Hormonal Imbalance**, and **High Risk** based on user-reported symptoms.  
The system is designed with a strong focus on **medical safety**, **accuracy**, and **real-world usability**.
